Data

To help Nikhil in his search we will need to access following data:

- The Localities of Mumbai, India from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Mumbai

- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) ot these neighborhoods of Mumbai from Open Street Map APIs

- From Foursquare we will need following venues data:
  - the gym venues of the neighborhood
  - the offices venues of the neighborhood
  - the high schools venues of the neighborhood
  - the universities venues of the neighborhood

We will then leverage the data in order to determine which locality is the most appropriate in order to locate the gym.
